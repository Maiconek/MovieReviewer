# MovieReviewer

It is the project that I wrote as my University assignment. It's basically a wannabe 'Filmweb' clone app. So we can add and rate movies, also we can wrote specific informations about the movie, we can add actors/directors/tags to the movie. It was built with use of:
- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- Django
- Bootstrap 4
